- direction followed : 
  - **Education**: IDE, SQL tools, notebook tutorials, graphics and interactivity, Operations Research
  - **Data Science**: Pandas, StatsModels, SQL, Machine Learning, Web Scraping, SpreadSheets
  - **Open Science**: Jupyter/Ipython, the Browser to do and share everything, containers

### Plan to keep alive and improving Winpython
- **simplicity**:
   - examples and tutorials in "Notebook" format,
   - complete out-of-the-box,
- **flexibility**:
   - easy to tweak in a "portable" way (zip and distribute your "mod" Winpython),
   - Flavor of the month (Winpython + added packages in a domain)
- **fun**:
   - make "I built my first Winpython !" a simple experience for advanced users,
   - contributing to Winpython is made easy on github and google mailing list.
