## Current roadmap

### Releases
- about every 4 to 8 weeks, depending of new features, updates of importance, and bugfix needs
- next Release : 201412 

### Direction : be the simplest experience for Windows users in 3 domains
- **Education / Development**: Spyder, IDLE, Scipy, Qt packages, Compilers, SQL packages, Scilab interface, ... 
- **Data Science** : Numpy/Pandas/Statsmodels/Requests , R interface, ...
- **Open Science** : Ipython/Jupyter/nbconvert , Julia interface, ...

### Plan to keep alive and improving Winpython
- simplicity :
   - examples and tutorials in "Notebook" format,
   - complete out-of-the-box,
- flexibility :
   - easy to further complete in a "portable" way (zip and distribute your modified Winpython),
   - Flavor of the month (Winpython + added packages in a domain)
- fun :
   - make "I built my first Winpython !" a (rather) simple experience for advanced users,
   - contributing to Winpython is made easy on github and google mailing list.
