- every 6 to 13 weeks (see  [Milestones](https://github.com/winpython/winpython/milestones))
- direction followed : 
  - **Education**: IDE, SQL tools, notebook tutorials, graphics and interactivity, Operations Research
  - **Data Science**: Pandas, StatsModels, SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Web Scraping, SpreadSheets
  - **Open Science**: Jupyter/Ipython, the Browser to do and share everything, containers

### Plan to keep alive and improving Winpython
- **simplicity**:
   - examples and tutorials in "Notebook" format,
   - complete out-of-the-box,
   - promote and use the 'standard' python packaging tools.
- **flexibility**:
   - easy to tweak in a "portable" way (zip and distribute your "mod" Winpython),
   - several official versions, to match different user needs, 
   - buildable in the Cloud
- **fun**:
   - make "I built my own Winpython !" a simpler experience for advanced users,
   - make contributing to Winpython easier:code & tutorials via github, google group and stackoverflow for answers, ...
