## Current roadmap
 
### Releases 
- every 4 to 8 weeks (next = december 2014)
- direction followed : 
  - "Education": IDE, SQL tools, notebook tutorials, graphics and interactivity
  - "Data Science": Pandas, StatModels, SQL, Compilers
  - "Open Science": Jupyter/Ipython, the Browser to do and share everything.

### Plan to keep alive and improving Winpython
- simplicity:
   - examples and tutorials in "Notebook" format,
   - complete out-of-the-box,
- flexibility:
   - easy to further complete in a "portable" way (zip and distribute your "mod" Winpython),
   - Flavor of the month (Winpython + added packages in a domain)
- fun:
   - make "I built my first Winpython !" a simple experience for advanced users,
   - contributing to Winpython is made easy on github and google mailing list.
