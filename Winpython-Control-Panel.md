The Winpython Control Panel (WPCP) has two principal functionalities:

  * Management of installed packages
  * Registering Winpython as Python-Interpreter

# Package management

To get a list of installed packages, switch to tab *Uninstall packages* and browse through the list.

To install packages, you can download the source tarballs (mostly `.tar.gz` files) and select them in the WPCP. Note that some packages need compilation (e.g. the preinstalled Numpy and some other), then you need precompiled packages. For more information see [[Installing Additional Packages]].

# Installation / Registration as installed Python distribution

See [[Installation]]
