## WinPython 2 or WinPython 3

**Two major versions** of the Python programming language are currently maintained: [Python 2 and Python 3](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).

In 2014, **Python 3.4 is the suggested version for most situations**, but some users may prefer Python 2.7 (or Python 3.3 ) for whatever reason.

As a consequence : 
- WinPython also provides a version for Python 3.3 and Python 2.7,
- WinPython tries to include only packages available in all 3 versions.

Package Index: 
- [WinPython 3.4](PackageIndex_34)
- [WinPython 3.3](PackageIndex_33)
- [WinPython 2.7](PackageIndex_27)
